            <h2>The Hyena</h2>
            <p>There are two species of hyenas in Kenya: the striped hyena and the spotted hyena. They can be found throughout Africa in all habitats except rainforests.</p>
            <p>Spotted hyenas, also called laughing hyenas, are the largest hyena species, with females being larger than the males. Their coats are patterned with dark spots. These animals hunt fish, birds, and even hippo calves, and can work in packs to take down wildebeests or antelope.</p>
            <p>Striped hyenas are lesser known than their spotted cousins. They are more scavengers than hunters and typically come out at night to feed on carcasses left by other animals.</p>
            <p>The IUCN lists both hyenas as of least concern and as having a stable population, though they are threatened by hunters, diseases, and drought.</p>
